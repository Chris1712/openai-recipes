1. Combine the corn flour, water, salt, and vegetable oil in a bowl and stir until the ingredients are fully combined.
2. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes to form a smooth, pliable dough.
3. Divide the dough into small balls, depending on the size of the pupusas you want to make.
4. Flatten each ball of dough and add your desired filling to the center.
5. Fold the dough over the filling, sealing the edges well.
6. Use your hands to flatten the pupusa and shape it into a disc.
7. Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-high heat and lightly grease with oil.
8. Cook the pupusas for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and slightly firm to the touch.
9. Serve immediately with salsa, curtido, and/or sour cream. Enjoy!
