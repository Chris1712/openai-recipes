1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
2. In a bowl, combine masa harina, water and salt. Mix well and knead for about 5 minutes.
3. If using lard, melt in a small skillet over medium heat. Add to the masa harina mixture and mix until well combined. If using vegetable oil, simply add it to the mixture and mix until well combined.
4. Place a sheet of plastic wrap or wax paper on a work surface. Place the dough on top and flatten with your hands into a disc. Cut out small circles using a biscuit cutter or glass.
5. Place the circles on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 10 minutes, then remove from oven and let cool.
6. To assemble, top each sope with refried beans, shredded chicken or beef, cheese, salsa, etc. Serve immediately.
