2 cups masa harina

1 1/2 cups water

1/2 cup shortening

1 teaspoon salt

2 cups shredded chicken

1 cup salsa

1/2 cup chopped onions

1/2 cup chopped green bell peppers

Instructions:

1. In a large bowl, combine the masa harina, water, shortening, and salt. Mix well.

2. In another bowl, combine the chicken, salsa, onions, and bell peppers.

3. To assemble the tamales, spread about 1/4 cup of the masa mixture evenly over the center of a large corn husk.

4. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the chicken mixture down the center of the masa.

5. Fold up the bottom of the husk, then the sides, and tie with a strip of husk or string.

6. Repeat with the remaining husks and filling.

7. Place the tamales in a steamer and steam for about 1 hour, or until the masa is cooked through.

8. Serve with additional salsa, if desired.
