Ingredients:
1 pound potatoes

1 egg

1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/4 teaspoon black pepper

1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

2. Bake potatoes in preheated oven for 45 minutes or until easily pierced with a fork.

3. Cool potatoes slightly and peel. Mash with a potato masher or ricer.

4. In a large bowl, stir together mashed potatoes, egg, Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Gradually stir in flour until dough is just firm enough to handle.

5. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into 1/2-inch-thick ropes. Cut ropes into 1-inch pieces.

6. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add gnocchi and cook for 2 to 4 minutes or until they float. Remove with a slotted spoon.

7. Serve with your favorite sauce.
