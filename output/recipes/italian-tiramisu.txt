Ingredients:
1 (8-ounce) package mascarpone cheese

1/2 cup heavy cream

1/4 cup sugar

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

24 ladyfingers

1/4 cup strong brewed coffee, cooled

1 tablespoon rum

1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder

Directions:

In a medium bowl, beat the mascarpone, cream, sugar, and vanilla until light and fluffy.

Split the ladyfingers in half lengthwise. Dip the ladyfingers into the coffee mixture, and then arrange in the bottom of a 9-inch square baking dish.

Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers, and sprinkle with half of the cocoa powder. Repeat the layers.

Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight.
