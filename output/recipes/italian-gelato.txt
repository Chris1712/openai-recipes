Ingredients:
1/2 gallon whole milk

1/2 cup granulated sugar

1/2 teaspoon salt

1 vanilla bean, split and scraped

8 egg yolks

1/2 cup heavy cream

1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:

1) Heat the milk, sugar, salt and vanilla bean in a large saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, then remove from the heat.

2) In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks. Slowly pour the hot milk mixture into the yolks, whisking constantly, then pour the mixture back into the saucepan.

3) Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon.

4) Remove from the heat and stir in the heavy cream and vanilla extract.

5) Pour the mixture into a large container and place in the freezer. Stir every 30 minutes or so until the gelato is frozen.
