Ingredients:
1/2 cup milk

1/2 cup water

1 tsp sugar

1 package dry yeast

3 cups all-purpose flour

1 tsp salt

1/4 cup vegetable oil

1/2 cup plain yogurt

Directions:

1. In a small bowl, combine milk, water and sugar. Sprinkle yeast over the top and let stand for 5 minutes, until foamy.

2. In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture, oil and yogurt. Stir until the dough comes together.

3. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead for 10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour.

4. Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.

5. Divide the dough into 12 pieces and shape into oval-shaped flatbreads. Grill for 2-3 minutes per side, until lightly browned and cooked through.
