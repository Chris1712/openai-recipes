Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground pork

1/4 cup chopped onion

1/4 cup chopped cabbage

1 tablespoon soy sauce

1 teaspoon grated ginger

1 garlic clove, minced

32 wonton wrappers

1 tablespoon vegetable oil

1/4 cup chicken broth

Directions:

1. In a medium bowl, mix together pork, onion, cabbage, soy sauce, ginger and garlic.

2. Place wonton wrappers on a work surface. Spoon 1 teaspoon of the pork mixture into the center of each wrapper. Moisten the edges of the wrappers with water. Fold the wrappers in half, pressing to seal.

3. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add gyoza and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side.

4. Add chicken broth and bring to a boil. Cover and cook until the gyoza are cooked through, about 3 minutes.
