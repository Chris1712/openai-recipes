Ingredients:
1 cup Arborio rice

1 onion, chopped

2 tablespoons olive oil

4 cups chicken broth

1/2 cup dry white wine

1/4 cup Parmesan cheese

Directions:

1. In a large saucepan, heat the chicken broth over medium heat.

2. In a separate saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.

3. Add the rice and cook, stirring frequently, until the rice is evenly coated with the oil and the onion is evenly distributed throughout.

4. When the broth is hot, add the wine and stir to combine.

5. Add the broth, 1 cup at a time, stirring constantly until each cup of broth is absorbed before adding the next.

6. After all the broth has been added, stir in the Parmesan cheese and serve immediately.
