Ingredients:
1 cup plain flour

1/4 teaspoon salt

1/4 teaspoon baking powder

1/4 teaspoon carom seeds

2 tablespoons ghee

1/2 cup water (approx)

oil for frying

Method:

Sift flour, salt, baking powder and carom seeds together. Add ghee and rub into flour until it resembles breadcrumbs. Add water and knead to make a pliable dough.

Divide dough into 3 parts. Take one part and roll out into a thin sheet. Using a sharp knife, make thin strips. Cut strips into small pieces.

Repeat with remaining dough.

Heat oil in a frying pan. When hot, add the sev and fry until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve sev warm or cold.
