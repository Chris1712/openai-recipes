Ingredients:
2 cups urad dal (black gram)

1 teaspoon baking soda

1 teaspoon salt

1 tablespoon cumin seeds

1 tablespoon fenugreek seeds

1 tablespoon black seeds

1 tablespoon white seeds

2 teaspoons red chili powder

1 tablespoon ghee (clarified butter)

Directions:

Soak the urad dal in water for 5 to 6 hours. Drain and grind to a fine paste.

Add the baking soda, salt, cumin seeds, fenugreek seeds, black seeds, white seeds, red chili powder and ghee and mix well.

Divide the mixture into small balls and flatten each ball between your palms to form a thin disc.

Heat a tava (griddle) and cook each disc on both sides until golden brown. Serve hot.
